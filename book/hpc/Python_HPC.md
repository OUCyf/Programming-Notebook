## Multiple Threading



### Global Interpreter Lock

Because of the existence of `Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)`, multi-threads code in multi-cores system can only run one thread at a time. Each thread needs to `acquire` a lock before it can run, and after the thread finishes running, the lock is `released`, and another thread acquires the lock again. So multiple threading is sutiable for `IO bound` mission, not the `CPU bound` mission

**Create a thread, start a thread, and wait thread finished running:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
import threading
import time

def thread_job():
    print('thread_job start\n')
    print('This is a thread of %s \n' % threading.current_thread())
    print('thread_job finish\n')

def main():
    # add a new thread
    thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_job, name="thread_job")

    # start a thread
    thread.start()

    # wait this thread finished running, then run following code
    thread.join()

    # see how many threads is running now
    print("There are", threading.active_count(), 'threads is running now\n') 

    # see the thread list
    print("The running threads list is:", threading.enumerate(), '\n') 

    # which one thread is running now
    print("The thread", threading.current_thread(), 'is running now\n') 

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**s:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
import threading
import time
from queue import Queue

def job(l,q):
    for i in range(len(l)):
        l[i] = l[i]**2
    q.put(l)

def multithreading():
    q = Queue()
    threads = []
    data = [[1,2,3],[3,4,5],[4,4,4],[5,5,5]]
    for i in range(4):
        t = threading.Thread(target=job, args=(data[i], q))
        t.start()
        threads.append(t)
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    results = []
    for _ in range(4):
          results.append(q.get())
    print(results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    multithreading()
```



### Thread Pool

A `thread pool` maintains multiple threads waiting for tasks to be allocated for `concurrent` execution by the supervising program. By maintaining a pool of threads, the model increases performance and avoids latency in execution due to frequent creation and destruction of threads for short-lived tasks. The number of available threads is tuned to the computing resources available to the program, such as a parallel task queue after completion of execution.


One benefit of a thread pool over creating a new thread for each task is that **thread creation and destruction overhead is restricted to the initial creation of the pool**, which may result in better performance and better system stability. Creating and destroying a thread and its associated resources can be an expensive process in terms of time. An excessive number of threads in reserve, however, wastes memory, and context-switching between the runnable threads invokes performance penalties.
