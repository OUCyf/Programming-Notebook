## Introduction

[Globus](https://www.globus.org/) is a secure, reliable **research data management** service. It works as a bridge between the remote endpoint and the local endpoint,  and itâ€™s a better alternative tool for [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/).


:::{admonition} What is the Globus?
With Globus, subscribers can move, share, publish & discover data via a single
interface, whether your files live on a supercomputer, lab cluster, tape archive,
public cloud or your laptop, you can manage this data from anywhere, using your
existing identities, via just a web browser.
