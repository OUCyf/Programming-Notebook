# Introduction âœ¨

Welcome to **Programming Notebook**, a notebook mainly about my scientific notes and gain in learning programming and geophysics, and I will be very glad if it is helpful for your researches too. 

**Enjoy** ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

2. **Programming Manual and Scripts**: some common and useful code scripts.

3. **Parallel Computing and Hybrid Programming**: common strategies for parallel computing and hybrid programming between Python and C++.

4. **Seismic Data Processing**: seismic data processing process included *read/write/filter/trim...* and so on.

## About the Book

The Seismology Notebook is powered by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), which use [MyST](https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/sbt-theme/grids.html) Markdown syntax.


All the source file are edited by VSCode, `run_jb_build.py` is a Python script to build the HTML and fresh it in Chrome browser automatically. 

- `run_jb_build.py` uses `git` to check whether any of the files have been changed. If something changed, it will rebuild the notebook and refresh the HTML in Chrome browser.

- `run_jb_build.py` uses `git` in `dev` branch, and after modifying all files, you need switch to `main` branch, and push it to Github.

- put `run_jb_build.py` in the root directory of your notebook project, and run it before you edit anytime.

Use jupyter-book generate html automatically.
    1. Download Chrome-driver Plug-in for selenium package from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
    2. Make sure the project have 'dev' branch
    3. Run this script in the root directory of book-project
