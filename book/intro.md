## About the Book ‚ú®

The notebook is powered by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), which use [MyST](https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/sbt-theme/grids.html) Markdown syntax.


All the source file are edited by VSCode, `run_jb_build.py` is a Python script to build the HTML and fresh it in Chrome browser automatically. 

- `run_jb_build.py` uses `git` to check whether any of the files have been changed. If something changed, it will rebuild the notebook and refresh the HTML in Chrome browser.

- `run_jb_build.py` uses `git` in `dev` branch, and after modifying all files, you need switch to `main` branch, and push it to Github.

- put `run_jb_build.py` in the root directory of your notebook project, and run it before you edit anytime.

    1. Download Chrome-driver Plug-in for selenium package from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
